A Refresher on Randomized Controlled Experiments,"In order to make smart decisions at work, we need data. Where that data comes from and how we analyze it depends on a lot of factors — for example, what we’re trying to do with the results, how accurate we need the findings to be, and how much of a budget we have. There is a spectrum of experiments that managers can do from quick, informal ones, to pilot studies, to field experiments, and to lab research. One of the more structured experiments is the randomized controlled experiment­.",Harvard Business Review,https://bit.ly/3FCWdm3,2022-12-18,Articles,Statistics
A Refresher on Statistical Significance,"When you run an experiment or analyze data, you want to know if your findings are “significant.” But business relevance (i.e., practical significance) isn’t always the same thing as confidence that a result isn’t due purely to chance (i.e., statistical significance). This is an important distinction; unfortunately, statistical significance is often misunderstood and misused in organizations today. And yet because more and more companies are relying on data to make critical business decisions, it’s an essential concept for managers to understand.",Harvard Business Review,https://bit.ly/3hxF5Gk,2022-12-18,Articles,Statistics
Interpreting ACF and PACF Plots for Time Series Forecasting,Autocorrelation analysis is an important step in the Exploratory Data Analysis of time series forecasting. The autocorrelation analysis helps detect patterns and check for randomness. It’s especially important when you intend to use an autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) model for forecasting because it helps to determine its parameters. The analysis involves looking at the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots.,Medium,https://towardsdatascience.com/interpreting-acf-and-pacf-plots-for-time-series-forecasting-af0d6db4061c,2022-12-23,Articles,Statistics
What does a box plot tell you?,"In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot (also known as box and whisker plot) is a type of chart often used in explanatory data analysis. Box plots visually show the distribution of numerical data and skewness through displaying the data quartiles (or percentiles) and averages.
