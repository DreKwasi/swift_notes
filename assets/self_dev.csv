What Are the Benefits of a Learning Orientation?,"Alan R. Mulally, the former CEO of Ford, believed that it is important to learn from everyone and understand their perspectives, experiences, and successes and failures.According to John W. Gardner, a leadership scholar, it is more important to be an interested person rather than an interesting person. In organizational psychology, this desire to be interested and learn is called having a ""learning orientation."" This means approaching situations with the intention of learning and being open to learning from others. It is contrasted with a ""performance orientation,"" which is focused on demonstrating competence. While demonstrating competence is important, it can sometimes prevent people from asking questions and learning from others because it implies that they already have all the answers",Psychology Today,https://bit.ly/3hwjGgN,2022-12-17,Articles,Self Development
