A/B Testing for Data Science using Python – A Must-Read Guide for Data Scientists,"Picture this scenario – You have made certain changes to your website recently. Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing with full accuracy how the next 100,000 people who visit your website will behave. That is the information we cannot know today, and if we were to wait until those 100,000 people visited our site, it would be too late to optimize their experience.

This seems to be a classic Catch-22 situation!

This is where a data scientist can take control. A data scientist collects and studies the data available to help optimize the website for a better consumer experience. And for this, it is imperative to know how to use various statistical tools, especially the concept of A/B Testing.",Analytics Vidhya,https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/ab-testing-data-science/,2022-12-18,Articles,Python
Learn Object Oriented Programming,"The main benefit of writing your code in an object-oriented way is to structure your program into simple, reusable pieces of code.

Stick with me through this article and you'll have a full understanding of the core tenets of OOP by the end.

20 Must-Know Pandas Function for Exploratory Data Analysis,"Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is an important component as well as one of the most under-estimated steps in any Data Science project. EDA is essential for well-defined and structured data analysis and should be performed before the machine learning modeling phase.

It involves finding insights from the data upon careful observation and further summarizing its main characteristics. Generally, the real-life data which we work upon contains a lot of ‘noise’, and therefore performing data analysis manually on such datasets becomes a complicated and tedious process.",Analytics Vidhya,https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/20-must-known-pandas-function-for-exploratory-data-analysis-eda/,2022-12-24,Articles,Python

How to Remove a Key from a Dictionary While Iterating Over it,"Python dictionaries allow you to store values in a Key and Value format. You can access the values using the key. You can also iterate through the complete dictionary to access every element. Sometimes while iterating through the dictionary, you may need to remove a key from the dictionary. This tutorial will teach you how to remove a key from a dictionary while iterating over it.",freeCodeCamp,"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-remove-a-key-from-the-dictionary-while-iterating-over-it-definitive-guide/#:~:text=First%2C%20you%20need%20to%20convert,statement%20to%20delete%20the%20key.",2022-12-30,Articles,Python
How to Add a User Authentication Service in Streamlit,"Streamlit is a framework for building web applications, but it does not have a built-in feature for implementing secure login and authentication services. This can be a problem for developers who want to create apps with restricted or sensitive content that can only be accessed by a specific audience. Streamlit Cloud, a premium version of Streamlit, does offer authentication as a feature, but for self-deployed Streamlit applications, there is currently no easy way to add login forms. However, the Streamlit-Authenticator tool can be used to add secure authentication to Streamlit apps.",Medium,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-add-a-user-authentication-service-in-streamlit-a8b93bf02031,2022-12-30,Articles,Python
