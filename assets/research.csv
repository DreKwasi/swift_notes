"Experimental Design: Types, Examples & Methods","Experimental design is a way to allocate participants in an experiment to different groups in order to test a research hypothesis. There are several types of experimental designs, including repeated measures, independent groups, and matched pairs. One common approach is to divide participants into an experimental group and a control group, where the experimental group is subjected to a change and the control group is not, in order to observe the effects of the change on the experimental group.",Simply Psychology,https://www.simplypsychology.org/experimental-designs.html,2022-12-18,Articles,Research
Combined deep learning and molecular docking simulations approach identifies potentially effective FDA approved drugs for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health. Drug repurposing is a time-efficient approach to finding effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in this emergency. Here, we present a robust experimental design combining deep learning with molecular docking experiments to identify the most promising candidates from the list of FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19.
